# Project Scan

**Description:**  
This script scans a set of folders and files, aggregates metadata (or contents), and outputs that data into a JSON file. It was created to provide data for other scripts (like the Patch File Creator) or to assist in data collection/scraping tasks.

## Features

- **Recursive Folder Scan:** Recursively scans specified directories.
- **Data Aggregation:** Collects file paths, contents, or relevant metadata.
- **JSON Output:** Exports the aggregated information into a structured JSON file for further processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Uses standard libraries (`os`, `json`, `pathlib`, etc.).

## Installation

No special installation steps; just ensure Python 3 is available.

## Usage
- 1. **Specify the directories** to scan (either in the script or via command-line arguments, depending on your implementation).
- 2. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    python project_scan.py
  Review the output JSON to see the aggregated data.
